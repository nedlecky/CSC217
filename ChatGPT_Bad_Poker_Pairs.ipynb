        "After choosing suits for the first pair, there are only 2 suits left for the second pair, so you have C(2, 2) ways to choose the suits for the second pair.\n",

        "There are 11 remaining ranks (since you've already chosen ranks for the pairs), so you have 11 choices for the kicker rank.\n",

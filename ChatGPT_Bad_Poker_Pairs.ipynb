        "In poker, the probability of being dealt a two-pair hand depends on the specific variant of poker you are playing and the number of players at the table. Here, I'll provide the probability of being dealt a two-pair hand in a standard five-card poker hand, assuming a single deck of 52 cards and a 5-card hand.\n",

        "A two-pair hand consists of two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one card of a third rank (the \"kicker\"). To calculate the probability of being dealt a two-pair hand, you can break it down into the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Step 1: Choose the ranks for the two pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 13 ranks (2 through Ace), so you have C(13, 2) ways to choose the two ranks for the pairs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each rank has 4 suits, so you have C(4, 2) ways to choose the suits for the first pair.\n",
        " * Step 3: Choose the suits for the second pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "After choosing suits for the first pair, there are only 2 suits left for the second pair, so you have C(2, 2) ways to choose the suits for the second pair.\n",
        " * Step 4: Choose the rank for the kicker.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 11 remaining ranks (since you've already chosen ranks for the pairs), so you have 11 choices for the kicker rank.\n",
        " * Step 5: Choose the suit for the kicker.\n",
        "\n",
        "The kicker can have any of the 4 suits, so you have C(4, 1) ways to choose the suit for the kicker.\n",
        "Now, multiply the choices from each step to calculate the total number of ways to be dealt a two-pair hand:\n",
        "\n",
        "Total ways = C(13, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) * 11 * C(4, 1)\n",

        "To calculate the probability, divide the total number of ways to get a two-pair hand by the total number of possible 5-card hands (C(52, 5)):\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability = (Total ways) / C(52, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can calculate this probability, and it will give you the probability of being dealt a two-pair hand in a standard 5-card poker hand. Keep in mind that the probability may vary in different poker variants or with different deck sizes."
